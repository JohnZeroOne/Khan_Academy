 
Project: Word game

We've started a webpage with a classic word game - the player sees a scrambled word, inputs what they think it is, and wins if they get it right. In this project, your goal is to add the jQuery needed for that game logic. Once you've got that working, add more words, style the win/lose message, and do anything else you think the game needs.
