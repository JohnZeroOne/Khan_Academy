 
Spin-off of "Project: Make it Rain"

To make an animation of rain, it's best if we use arrays to keep track of the drops and their different properties. Start with this simple code and build on it to make a cool rain animation. Here are some ideas for what you could do:

    Add more drops to the arrays.
    Make it so that the drops start back at the top once they've reached the bottom, using a conditional.
    Make an array of colors, so that every drop is a different color.
    Make other things rain, like snowflakes (using more shape commands) or avatars (using the image commands).
    Make it so that when the user clicks, a new drop is added to the array.
    Initialize the arrays using a for loop and random() function, at the beginning of the program.
