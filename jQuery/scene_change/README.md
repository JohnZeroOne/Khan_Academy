 
Project: Scene change

In this project, you'll make an interactive scene using HTML images, CSS positioning, and jQuery events.

Start by making something when the user clicks on the Leafers avatar in the webpage. You could change the image (like into an older version of Leafers), play a sound (see example), pop up a div that looks like a speech bubble - anything like that!

Then add at least 2 more interactive elements that changes when the user clicks it.

Don't like the beach or Leafers? Feel free to change the starting images if you'd like. Have fun with it!
