 
Spin-off of "Project: What's for Dinner?"

Now that you've learned how to draw and color shapes, use your skills to make something fun: dinner!

The program below only includes a simple plate, it's up to you to put dinner on the plate. Use shapes like rect(), ellipse(), and triangle() to draw food on the plate. Use fill() and stroke() to color them. Don't remember how to use something? Check the "Documentation" tab and click for examples.

After you're done, show it to your friends and family. Offer to cook them it for dinner tomorrow. :-)
